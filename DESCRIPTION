Description: ReLTER is an R package that: provides access to DEIMS-SDR
    (https://deims.org/), allows interact with software implemented by eLTER
    Research Infrastructure (RI) and improves the data/information shared by
    them.
    ReLTER is a R package devoted to access, interact and improve the
    information and the data shared by Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)
    network. This package is born within eLTER H2020 major project that will
    help advance the development of European Long-Term Ecosystem Research
    Infrastructures (eLTER RI - https://elter-ri.eu).
    The ReLTER package functions in particular allow to:
    - retrive the information about entities (e.g. sites, datasets, and
    activities) shared by DEIMS-SDR (see e.g. get_site_info function);
    - interact with the [ODSEurope](maps.opendatascience.eu) managed by members
    of the [Geo-harmonizer](https://opendatascience.eu/geoharmonizer-project/)
    project starting with the dataset shared by [DEIMS-SDR](https://deims.org/)
    (see e.g. [get_site_ODS](https://oggioniale.github.io/ReLTER/reference/get_site_ODS.html)
    function);
    - use the site informations for download data from other platforms (see
    e.g. get_site_ODS function);
    - improve the quality of the dataset (see e.g. get_id_worms).
    Functions currently implemented are derived from the discussion of the
    needs declared by eLTER users community.
    The ReLTER package shall definitely follow the progress of eLTER-RI
    infrastructure and evolving with the improvements and develop of
    new tools.
