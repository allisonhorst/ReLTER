The peculiarity of this area is strictly related to its geographic location, corrisponding to the winter surface isotherm of 14\u00b0C that cuts the Mediterranean Sea into two and represents a climatic boundary barrier for species with different biogeographic affinities. The richness in marine species and habitats of this area (including the islands of Ischia, Procida and Vivara) is preserved by the establishment in 2008 of the Marine Protected Area \u2018Regno di Nettuno\u2019. \r\nOne of the most important habitat of the Gulf of Naples is represented by the Posidonia oceanica beds, an endemic seagrass that forms around the island of Ischia a continuous belt, from 0.5 m down to 38 m in depth, covering about 1700ha of the seafloor.  Several meadows have been studied by the Benthic Group, located at Villa Dohrn on the Island of Ischia: Scarrupata di Barano, Cava dell\u2019Isola, La Nave, San Pietro, Castello Aragonese  and Lacco Ameno. \r\nThe best-known meadow is that of Lacco Ameno (LA), studied since 1976, and located in the northern part of the island, in the bay bounded by \u2018Monte Vico\u2019 and the city of Lacco Ameno (40,7598 N, 13,900 E). Only in this station, the meadow is continuous from 0.5 m down to 32 m in depth and it covers an area of about 308 ha.\r\nIn this pilot site (Station LTER-LA), a significant variability at different spatial and temporal scales has been recorded for plant descriptors and associated communities. In particular, at 5 and 10 m depths, a decrease in meadow density (a descriptor of the ecological status of a meadow, widely used by many authors to indicate the plant abundance) is evident since the end of 1980. This fact seems to suggest an increase in the anthropic pressure, even if other factors, such as physical disturbance, topographic complexity and nutrient availability, might operate to modify this system. \r\nThe high plasticity of P. oceanica, which responds to a wide range of environmental conditions, have driven our researches towards the study of the effects of climatic changes, such as ocean acidifcation, on this vegetated system.  Issues associated to climate changes are being approached  also by the comparison  with another Ischia P.oceanica meadow.  This is located at Castello Aragonese (40,73083\u00b0N 13,96310\u00b0E), on the east side of the island, where  a number of vents which release CO2 affect the P. oceanica system. These CO2 vents are unusual in that they are not heated and neither do they produce toxic compounds, providing a natural laboratory for the study of the ecosystem level effects of ocean acidification. \r\n","keywords":[{"label":"biodiversity","uri":null},{"label":"phenology","uri":null},{"label":"primary production","uri":null},{"label":"taxonomy","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1976,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":[{"type":"site","title":"IT13-Gulf of Naples - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"0f59e22d-1db8-481e-a8b7-f2810fcfc178"},"changed":"2021-11-23T11:15:24+0100"}],"children":null},"siteName":"LTER Lacco Ameno","shortName":"IT13-002-M","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":[{"label":"Category IV \u2013 Habitat\/Species Management Area","uri":"http:\/\/dd.eionet.europa.eu\/vocabularyconcept\/cdda\/IucnCategoryValue\/IV"}],"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/Lacco%2520-%2520Castello_0.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":19.9,"min":13,"max":28,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":0,"min":0,"max":0,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"marine","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Marine","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Marine habitats (A)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Marine"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":null,"coordinates":"POINT (13.9 40.7598)","country":["Italy"],"elevation":{"avg":-16,"min":-0.5,"max":-32,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":308,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"no experimentation","scale":"plot scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"plot within catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"genetic parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20942"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"biodiversity","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21673"},{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"chemistry","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21656"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"genetics","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21613"},{"label":"oceanography","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21759"},{"label":"physiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21651"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"boat","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":90,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":"All the operations are performed in situ by scuba divers at both the depths (5 and 22)\r\nMeadow density is measured by means of quadrats placed randomly; reconstructive plant production is estimated by sampling a fixed numbers of vertical rhizomes.
