It is also a representative region of very fragile high mountains and deep valleys in the east part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with a difference in elevation more than 3000 m\uff0eThe vertical distributions of vegetation and climate are found very obvious there. The region belongs to the typical temperate climate with annual sunshine time of 1373.8 hours, annual mean temperature 9.3\u2103, annual precipitation 825.2 mm and annual evaporation 968.7 mm. In the area of the station, the major soil types are brown soil and cinnamon soil. The vegetation mainly consists of artificial forests and secondary shrubs. The Qiang people live in the region.","keywords":[{"label":"aboveground biomass","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1986,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Maoxian Mountain Ecosystem Research Station","shortName":"Maoxian Station","siteType":"Platform","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2126.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/IMG_1058_text.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":9.3,"min":-12,"max":30,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":825,"min":950,"max":700,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"evergreen_forest","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Forest","uri":null},{"label":"Temperate coniferous forests","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":null,"coordinates":"POINT (103.883 31.6833)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":1900,"min":1816,"max":2400,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":33.3,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"beyond catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"plot within catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"hydrology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21747"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":false,"accessType":null,"allPartsAccessible":false,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Data portal","uri":null},{"label":"Web Catalog Service (CSW)","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Master Site"}}}}
