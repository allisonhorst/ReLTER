The lagoon is characterized by a clear zonation with the low energy eastern area separated from two higher energy zones, the western area influenced by freshwater inflow from the Po di Volano and the central area influenced by the sea The eastern zone is very shallow (maximum depth 1 m) and accounts for one half of the total surface area and one quarter of the water volume. The lagoon is surrounded by embankments. The main freshwater inputs are the Po di Volano River, the Canal Bianco and Giralda, which have approximately the same discharge rates. Freshwater inlets are also located along the Po di Goro River and are regulated by sluices. There are no direct estimates of the freshwater input from the Po di Goro, which is usually assumed to be equivalent to that of the Po di Volano. The freshwater system is mostly located in a subsident area and is regulated by a system of pumping stations (scooping plants). The fresh water or hydraulic residence time oscillates monthly between 2.5 and 122 days with a mean value of 24.5 days, whereas the water exchange time ranges from 2 to 4 days. The tidal amplitude is ca 80 cm. The bottom of the lagoon is flat and the sediment is alluvial mud with high clay and silt content in the northern and central zones. Sand is more abundant near the southern shoreline, whilst sandy mud occurs in the eastern area.\r\n","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":2008,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":[{"type":"site","title":"IT07-Lagoons of Po River Delta - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"b3ba9409-4953-446b-9890-5b977c4c1cb3"},"changed":"2021-11-23T11:14:36+0100"}],"children":null},"siteName":"Sacca di Goro","shortName":"IT07-001-M","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":null},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":15,"min":2,"max":32,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":690.9,"min":151.8,"max":201.2,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"coastal","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Coastal","uri":null},{"label":"Marine","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Coastal habitats (B)","uri":null},{"label":"Marine habitats (A)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Coastal"],"geology":"Coastal lagoon","hydrology":"Microtidal lagoon","soils":"Mud and sand","vegetation":"Marshes are peopled by a number of plant species having underwater roots and sometimes even underwater - or just emerging - leaves. These plants are called hydrophytes, that is, \u00b4water plants\u00b4. Among them, the Frogbit, the Willow grass, several types of Long-stalked Pondweed and Buttercups, the White Water-Lily. Other species, called helophytes, have underwater roots but emerging stems and leaves. Among them, some common species such as the Common reed and the Broadleaf Cattail, but also some localised ones, such as the Lesser Water-plantain, the Branched Bur-reed and the Arrowhead. Water bodies\u00b4 banks species live on the edge of wetlands and wet meadows, since they need to be flooded for some time but can not live with their roots underwater all the year round. The most common species, such as the Purple Loosestrife, the Marshmallow, the Comfrey and the Hemp agrimony, can be found even along countryside ditches. Some other species live only on the edge of marshlands and the main canals, such as the Flowering Rush and the Yellow Iris. The area also houses some rare and localised species, such as the Euphorbia palustris and the Summer Snowflake"},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((12.284176 44.817957, 12.274475 44.81862, 12.265892 44.815941, 12.263489 44.818133, 12.267609 44.823734, 12.275162 44.830309, 12.283745 44.836152, 12.292541 44.841841, 12.309494 44.841751, 12.312241 44.843455, 12.317734 44.842238, 12.317047 44.837613, 12.333527 44.828604, 12.333527 44.824708, 12.337303 44.82276, 12.339706 44.817403, 12.349663 44.816428, 12.363396 44.808635, 12.377833 44.799793, 12.392271 44.79095, 12.383652 44.785247, 12.373695 44.784272, 12.362022 44.784759, 12.350006 44.785734, 12.34108 44.785734, 12.33181 44.787196, 12.318922 44.790464, 12.299194 44.805712, 12.284176 44.817957))","coordinates":"POINT (12.31853 44.81409)","country":["Italy"],"elevation":{"avg":0,"min":0,"max":0,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":2600,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"partly experimentation","scale":"micro sites"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"sub-catchment within catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"chemical parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/10333"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"hydrology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21747"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"boat","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Other data services","uri":null},{"label":"Structured file","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["Co-authorship on publications resulting from use of the dataset"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Regular Site"}}}}
