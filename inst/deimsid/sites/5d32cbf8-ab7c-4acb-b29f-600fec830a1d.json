This site is located in the Central Alps and it\u0027s grouped with LOM1;TRE1;FRI2 and Valbona in a cluster of sites called Forest of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Renon-Selva Verde site is located in the municipality of Renon, at a distance of 12.2 km North-Northeast from the town of Bolzano. Eddy covariance measurements started in the year 1997. The site is placed on a porphyric plateau; the soil is classified as Haplic Podsol following F.A.O. The site vegetation, a subalpine coniferous forest, is of natural origin and is used for wood production. As a result of the traditional harvesting method, which consists of irregular cuttings of 50-80 cubic meters, overall the forest is unevenly aged, but with homogenous groups. The largest group present in the area is growing approximately since the year 1820, after Napoleon wars. The main forest species is spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst., 85% in number) followed by cembran pine (Pinus cembra L., 12%) and larch (Larix decidua Mill., 3%). In the clearings, covering approximately 15% of the area, the dominant grass species is Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin. The canopy is irregular, with maximal height of 29 m. The mean leaf area index (LAI), measured by hemispherical photographs, is 5.1 m2 m-2. The climate is strongly influenced by elevation, with cool summer and moderately cold winter. Annual average temperature 4,6\u00b0C, average annual precipitation ammount 903 mm. An increase of the annual average temperature by 0,8\u00b0C were observed during the period 1990-2014.\r\n\r\n","keywords":[{"label":"aboveground production","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1992,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":[{"type":"site","title":"IT02-Forests of the Alps - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"ede67a31-079a-4db5-b3a2-83b22054c661"},"changed":"2021-11-23T11:13:45+0100"}],"children":null},"siteName":"Renon BOL1","shortName":"IT01","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/Renon%2520BOL1.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/renon-bol1-italy_4810.jpg","alt":"Micrometeorological tower with eddy covariance instruments to measure the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the forest and the atmosphere."},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/renon-bol1-italy_5071.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":4,"min":-18.3,"max":24.6,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":940.9,"min":0,"max":336,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":"alpine","biome":"evergreen_forest","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Evergreen Forest","uri":null},{"label":"Forest","uri":null},{"label":"Grasslands","uri":null},{"label":"Montane grasslands and shrublands","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Woodland, forest and other wooded land (G)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":"The pedogenetic substratum consists of a mixed morainic and detritus cover of porphyritic pebbles and stones on quatziferous porphyry of the Permian period (paleozoic).","hydrology":null,"soils":"Haplorthod according to soil Taxonomy Haplic Podsol according to the F.

In a soil cross-section at a depth between 75\/80 and 85\/95 cm macroscopic traces of carbonized wood were found: probably evidence of an ancient fire which destroyed the vegetative cover during the immediate post-glacial era: 7577 B.C. (dating using 14C). Analyses on the wood show that the tree population of that time was made up of purely light-demanding species: Scots pine, larch and birch. The present (climax) forest stand (age 120-140 years) consist mainly of the typical sub-alpine tree-species: norway spruce, cembran pine. In the shrubs layer principally bilberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Vaccinium mirtillus). Graminaceus patchy cover with Deschampsia flexuosa. Presence of Hieracium murorum, Melampyrum sylvaticum, Arnica montana, Potentilla tormentilla, Fragaria vesca, Phiteuma spicatum. Grazing was in the recent past a major problem, whose consequences, root damage and soil compactage, now appears after many decades in the form of root-rot diseases (e.g Armillaria)."},"geographic":{"boundaries":"MULTIPOLYGON (((11.432913812495 46.586906500839, 11.433402541185 46.587197921412, 11.433995344378 46.587365838723, 11.434270968492 46.586957507349, 11.434464148881 46.586609394352, 11.434248885623 46.586449344126, 11.433671870206 46.586213391218, 11.433298475263 46.586510031842, 11.432913812495 46.586906500839)))","coordinates":"POINT (11.4336 46.5868)","country":["Italy"],"elevation":{"avg":1740,"min":1720,"max":1763,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":0.8759,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":[{"title":"Renon BOL1","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/locations\/","suffix":"2134c2b2-ddbc-4482-87f3-8cbcfa5ef2de"},"changed":"2021-11-18T15:00:26+0100"}]},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"partly experimentation","scale":"plot scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"plot within catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"chemistry","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21656"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"meteorology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21752"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"regular car","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":14,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":"_","siteVisitInterval":14},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"1 place","uri":null},{"label":"10-100 kW","uri":null},{"label":"All over site\/catchment","uri":null},{"label":"Cable based","uri":null},{"label":"Less than 10 m above canopy","uri":null},{"label":"Monthly","uri":null},{"label":"No lodging possible","uri":null},{"label":"Radio transmission system (repeaters. receivers. centralstation)","uri":null},{"label":"Relational database","uri":null},{"label":"Telephone line","uri":null},{"label":"Vehicle 2WD","uri":null},{"label":"Web Feature Service (WFS)","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":"_"}}},"relatedResources":[{"id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/dataset\/","suffix":"7e56ebf6-14cd-4991-9bbd-10ccda7da90a"},"title":"Meteorology","changed":"2020-01-07T15:03:29+0100"},{"id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/dataset\/","suffix":"c6db8113-9f21-4975-9d5c-c627540812b2"},"title":"Biodiversity_Lepidoptera","changed":"2020-01-07T15:05:40+0100"},{"id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/dataset\/","suffix":"6499a7cc-df94-45ac-92ed-62f43360411d"},"title":"Deposition of N-NH4 and N-NO3 Renon Bol1 1985-207","changed":"2020-02-27T09:38:25+0100"}],"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Extensive Site"}}}}
