The Valli are, nowadays, constituted by three main basins, i.e. Valle Magnavacca, Valle Fossa di Porto and Valle Campo. This semi-enclosed lagoonal complex is almost completely surrounded by earthen dikes, and separated by the sea by the highly anthropogenically impacted, 2.5 km-wide Spina spit. The Valli are connected with the Adriatic Sea by three marine channels, Portocanale, Logonovo and Gobbino, but since the latter is impounded, major water exchange with the sea occurs only through the firsts two channels. The former receives also nutrient-enriched continental water from Valle Fattibello. Water exchange with the sea is both tidal and man-regulated. Moreover, from February to May, large amounts of freshwater are conveyed through the Reno river through two dams in the southermost parts of Valle Magnavacca and Valle Fossa di Porto. Due to the shallowness of the basins and their limited water renewal, salinity (annual range: 24-38 psu) is mostly influenced by meteorological events, such as evaporation and occasional heavy rainstorms. The bottoms of the Valli are typically muddy, but sparsely vegetated meadows of the seagrass Ruppia cirrhosa occur in the southern parts of the Valli Magnavacca and Fossa di Porto. These meadows are the remnants of the larger macrophytic coverage that characterized the bottom of the Valli in the early 1970s","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":2008,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":[{"type":"site","title":"IT07-Lagoons of Po River Delta - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"b3ba9409-4953-446b-9890-5b977c4c1cb3"},"changed":"2021-11-23T11:14:36+0100"}],"children":null},"siteName":"Valli di Comacchio","shortName":"IT07-002-M","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":null},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":15,"min":1,"max":33,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":680.3,"min":150.7,"max":200.4,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":"continental","biome":"coastal","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Coastal","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Coastal habitats (B)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Coastal"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((12.186186 44.660294, 12.152252 44.651559, 12.107553 44.652485, 12.100067 44.619799, 12.098694 44.603668, 12.10556 44.576774, 12.1138 44.575796, 12.124786 44.566013, 12.133713 44.569926, 12.139893 44.552803, 12.152289 44.549122, 12.176285 44.551824, 12.203751 44.558185, 12.21611 44.571883, 12.21199 44.577752, 12.22229 44.579708, 12.229156 44.576774, 12.239456 44.57873, 12.249436 44.58145, 12.22641 44.59389, 12.243576 44.600735, 12.23259 44.626152, 12.227097 44.647162, 12.219543 44.669141, 12.186186 44.660294))","coordinates":"POINT (12.16983 44.60741)","country":["Italy"],"elevation":{"avg":0,"min":0,"max":0,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":11500,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"micro sites"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"sub-catchment within catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"chemical parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/10333"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"chemistry","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21656"},{"label":"hydrology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21747"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":false,"accessType":"boat","allPartsAccessible":false,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Structured file","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["Co-authorship on publications resulting from use of the dataset"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Regular Site"}}}}
