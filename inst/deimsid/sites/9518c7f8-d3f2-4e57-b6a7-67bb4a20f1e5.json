TYA represents southern combined ecosystem of agriculture and forestry in hilly region with red clay soil, and is responsible for the monitoring the successions of agro-ecosystem in the region. The main research fields cover: the succession of agro-ecosystem and key environmental elements; the variations and adjustments of soil nutrient cycling and soil fertility; irrigation techniques and increase of water use efficiency in agricultural system; the biogeochemical processes and microbial functions of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling and restoration of degraded ecosystem. As a base for researches for agricultural and forestry ecosystems in red-earth hilly region, It has been certified as a member of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN), the National Field Research Stations of China (CNERN)and International Long Term Ecological Research\uff08ILTER\uff09. Besides, the station was qualified as a national base of scientific training for teenagers.","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1978,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Taoyuan Agricultural Ecological Station","shortName":"TYA","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/1966.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/text_2342.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/1975.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/1976.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/1977_.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":16.5,"min":null,"max":null,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":1440,"min":null,"max":null,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"agricultural","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Agricultural","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":null,"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((111.4379 28.9296, 111.4386 28.931, 111.4401 28.9315, 111.4419 28.9309, 111.44301697 28.930330619, 111.4431 28.9298, 111.4432 28.9287, 111.4429 28.9284, 111.4409 28.9279, 111.4384 28.9293, 111.4379 28.9296))","coordinates":"POINT (111.4333 28.9167)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":null,"min":92.2,"max":125.3,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":12.3,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"entire catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"agricultural parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20936"},{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"genetic parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20942"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"agriculture","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21605"},{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"genetics","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21613"},{"label":"terrestrial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/79"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":null,"allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Data portal","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":[{"title":"","value":"http:\/\/tya.cern.ac.cn"}],"rights":["Co-authorship on publications resulting from use of the dataset","Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Regular Site"}}}}
