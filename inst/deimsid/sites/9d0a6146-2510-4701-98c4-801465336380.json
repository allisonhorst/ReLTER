Urban ecosystem is a complex social-economic-ecological system dominated by human beings. Urban ecological elements, including climate, atmosphere, hydrology, soil, organisms, etc, and ecological process such as material flow, energy flow, etc, are products of interaction between human activity and natural environment. These will evolve with variation of the human-nature relation as well. Beijing is the center of policy, economy, culture, science and technology in China and it is also an international metropolis. Beijing covers 16,400 km2 (built area is 1204 km2) with population of more than 15, 810,000 in 2006.\r\n\r\nBeijing urban ecosystem research station was based on State Key Laboratory of Urban and regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and started constructing in 2001, consisting of monitoring net, indoor specimen analysis and conservation room, information data management and analysis room and official documentation room. Up till now, laboratories concerning air, water, soil and microorganism have been set up engaging in research of Beijing urban ecosystem\u2019s structure, typical process and function.\r\n\r\n","keywords":[{"label":"human-nature relation","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":2002,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Beijing Urban Ecosystem Research Station","shortName":"BJU","siteType":"Platform","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2136.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":12.1,"min":null,"max":null,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":610,"min":null,"max":null,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"urban","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Urban","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":null,"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((116.34203 40.00778, 116.344449 40.007744, 116.344426 40.010416, 116.3433 40.0103, 116.34203 40.00778))","coordinates":"POINT (116.3378 40.008579)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":43.5,"min":20,"max":60,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":47,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"plot scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"plot within catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"landscape parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20943"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"chemistry","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21656"},{"label":"conservation","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21663"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"},{"label":"hydrography","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/30004"},{"label":"hydrology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21747"},{"label":"social sciences","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/30006"},{"label":"toxicology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/10217"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"regular car","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":7,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":30},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"All over site\/catchment","uri":null},{"label":"Cable based","uri":null},{"label":"GMS\/UMTS","uri":null},{"label":"More than 100 kW","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["The data provider must be offered co-authorship for publications using this dataset at least within the metadata description","The opportunity to collaborate on the project using the dataset","At least part of the costs of dataset acquisition, retrieval or provision must be recovered.","The dataset provider is given a complete list of all products that make use of the dataset"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Master Site"}}}}
