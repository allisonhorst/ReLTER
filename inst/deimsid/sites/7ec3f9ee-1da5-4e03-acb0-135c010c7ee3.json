In particular the RNBF is situated in a transition zone from the high and the low gravely Po-plain of Mantova (Rioda, 2004).\r\nThe hydrological regime doesn\u2019t follow the natural trend, but it depends on the water management for the neighbouring fields irrigation. A deal with the water managing institution guaranties during the winter (the critical period for the water level fluctuations) a \u201cminimum vital flux\u201d for Rio Begotta and Roggia Sgarzabella, the two rivers running through the Reserve.\r\nThe grassland, located in the heart of the Reserve, is one of the last semi-natural formations existing in the province of Mantova at the present time.\r\nFor the management of the grassland the method of the cyclical rotational mowing is used (different pieces of grassland are mowed in different moments of the year); that technique allows the constant presence of grasses at disparate highness and guaranties the steady flowering during the summer period. This system\/modus operandi has the aim to diversify microhabitats and the consequent rise of biodiversity, in particular flora\u2019s entomological fauna.\r\nThe whole number of spontaneous plants in the Reserve is 470, of which 60 are considerated rare in the Po plain. There are about 50 allochthonous vegetal species now naturalized.\r\nThe faunistic researches have singled out 160 vertebrate species and 2,520 invertebrate species.\r\nIn the group of those there are 47 animal species protected  at the European level, that are listed in the annexes II and IV of the Habitat Directive and in the annex I of the Birds Directive (2 mollusc species, 5 insect species, 3 fishes species, 4 amphibian species, 6 reptile species, 21 bird species and 6 mammalian species)\r\nCurrently 30 allochthonous animal species have been recorded.\r\nThe people admittance in the reserve is limited throughout certain rules and it\u2019s modelled on the primary conservation\u2019s necessities.\r\nThe RNBF is the location of a research centre: the National Centre for the Study and Conservation of Forest Biodiversity.\r\n","keywords":[{"label":"canopy cover","uri":null},{"label":"forest dynamics","uri":null},{"label":"meteorology","uri":null},{"label":"rainfall chemical analysis","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1976,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":[{"type":"site","title":"Bosco Fontana - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"0585b394-faf2-4850-913f-6351aace73e4"},"changed":"2021-12-03T17:57:38+0100"}]},"siteName":"IT05-Lowland Forests","shortName":"IT05","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":[{"label":"Category Ia \u2013 Strict Nature Reserve","uri":"http:\/\/dd.eionet.europa.eu\/vocabularyconcept\/cdda\/IucnCategoryValue\/Ia"}],"landUse":null,"images":null},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":12.75,"min":2.7,"max":2.7,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":830.2,"min":164.5,"max":231,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":"continental","biome":"deciduous_forest","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Deciduous Forest","uri":null},{"label":"Forest","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Woodland, forest and other wooded land (G)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":null,"coordinates":"POINT (10.7333 45.2)","country":["Italy"],"elevation":{"avg":25,"min":24,"max":26,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":263,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"beyond catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"beyond catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"ozone concentration","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/22178"},{"label":"tree condition","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/22302"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"air chemistry","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21657"},{"label":"animal ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/71"},{"label":"biodiversity","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21673"},{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"chemistry","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21656"},{"label":"community ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/45"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"ecophysiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21652"},{"label":"ecosystem ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21689"},{"label":"forest ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21693"},{"label":"physiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21651"},{"label":"plant ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21710"},{"label":"terrestrial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/79"},{"label":"vegetation dynamics","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21711"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":false,"accessType":"dirt road  (4WD)","allPartsAccessible":false,"maintenanceInterval":7,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":7},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"1 - 5 beds","uri":null},{"label":"\u003E 5 places","uri":null},{"label":"Central station(s)","uri":null},{"label":"Other data services","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["Co-authorship on publications resulting from use of the dataset"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"ltser"}}}}
