This region has a typical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 13.9 \u00b0C and average annual precipitation of approximately 615 mm. The soil is derived from the alluvial sediments of the Yellow River and is classified as an aquic inceptisol (a calcareous, fluvo-aquic sandy loam (Soil Survey Staff, 2010)), with a sandy loam texture at the plough layer (0-20 cm). The experimental station is located in a region typical of the North China Plain, with the prevailing cropping system of wheat-corn rotation. The Station has 9.41 hectares of experimental fields, equipped with 1300 square meters of laboratories, 1500 square meters of living rooms, complete experimental equipments and living facilities, and two investigative cars. The Fengqiu Station is one of the main experimental field base, deployed by the country and Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and devoted to the agriculture, resource, ecology and environment research.","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1983,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Fengqiu Experimental Station for Agro-ecology Chinese Academy of Sciences","shortName":"Fengqiu Station","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/Fengqiu%2520Station%2520Gate.png","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/comprehensive%2520building%2520of%2520scientific%2520research.png","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/meteorological%2520observation%2520field.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/experimental%2520field.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/raspberry%2520breeding%2520base.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":13.9,"min":-11.9,"max":36.4,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":615,"min":0,"max":2707,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"agricultural","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Agricultural","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((114.5517 35.0206, 114.5529 35.0204, 114.5543 35.0183, 114.5544 35.0163, 114.5516 35.0163, 114.5524 35.0187, 114.5517 35.0206))","coordinates":"POINT (114.533 35.0167)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":67.5,"min":67.5,"max":67.5,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":10.613,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"entire catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"agricultural parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20936"},{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"ecosystem ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21689"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"},{"label":"microbial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/77"},{"label":"terrestrial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/79"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"regular car","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":365,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":365},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"All over site\/catchment","uri":null},{"label":"Data portal","uri":null},{"label":"Paper","uri":null},{"label":"Relational database","uri":null},{"label":"Structured file","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":[{"title":"","value":"http:\/\/fqa.cern.ac.cn"}],"rights":["The data provider must be offered co-authorship for publications using this dataset at least within the metadata description","Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Regular Site"}}}}
