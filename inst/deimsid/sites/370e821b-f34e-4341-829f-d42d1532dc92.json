The distance from station to Cele county, Hotan, Urumqi and Beijing is approximately 7.5, 100, 1500 and 4500 km, respectively.The Cele Desert Research Station of Chinese Academy of Sciences is located in Cele county at the southern rim of Taklimakan desert. In early 1980s, the distance from the Cele county to the forefront of aklimakan desert was only 1.5 km. In order to cope with the severe desertification threat to the city, Xinjiang Autonomous Region government organized the onsite meeting and decided to establish the research station.he climate is continental, with cold winters and hot dry summers. Mean annual temperature is 11.9 \u25e6C, the desert is hyper arid with mean annual precipitation of 35.1 mm and potential evaporation rate of 2595.3 mm. The snowmelt on Kunlun mountain is a predominant water supply source for this area. Additionally, sand storm disasters are very common occurring on an average of 20 days a year while lowing sand and suspended dust occurs around 240 days a year. These situations have resulted in a fragile ecosystem in the region. The Gobi and desert ccount for 95% of the total area. The coverage of natural vegetation, which is dominated by perennial desert plants, is less than 15%.","keywords":[{"label":"desertification","uri":null},{"label":"deserts","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1983,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Cele Desert Research Station","shortName":"Cele Station","siteType":"Platform","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/cld_lter_picture10.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/cld_lter_picture07.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/cld_lter_picture15_.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/CLDFZ04_2106.JPG","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/CLDFZ03_2105.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/CLDFZ01_2099.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/CLDFZ02_2101.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/CLDFZ05_2107.JPG","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/cld_lter_picture.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":11.9,"min":-23.9,"max":41.9,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":35.1,"min":68.8,"max":13.5,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"desert","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Desert","uri":null},{"label":"Deserts and xeric shrublands","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"MULTIPOLYGON (((80.71882 37.026308333333, 80.730855555555 37.031077777778, 80.726430555556 37.023561111111, 80.71845 37.016633333334, 80.71882 37.026308333333)), ((80.4223 37.003, 80.4229 37.003, 80.4229 37.0026, 80.4223 37.0025, 80.4223 37.003)))","coordinates":"POINT (80.72917 37.01583)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":1318,"min":1318,"max":1318,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":130,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"beyond catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"beyond catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"acid neutralising capacity","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/10310"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"soil acidity","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/22243"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"biogeography","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21738"},{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"ecophysiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21652"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"},{"label":"geography","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21737"},{"label":"physiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21651"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":false,"accessType":"regular car","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":365,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":365},"notes":"There are 45 experimental instruments and observation equipment in Cele station, including AA3 Segmented Flow Analyzer, UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, Automatic Kjeldahl Apparatus, Photosynthesis Analyzer, Eddy Covariance tower, etc. These equipment and instruments value over 8 million RMB, and can satisfy the routine monitoring and analysis of samples.","collection":[{"label":"Data portal","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":[{"title":"","value":"http:\/\/cld.cern.ac.cn\/"}],"rights":["The data provider must be offered co-authorship for publications using this dataset at least within the metadata description"],"notes":"readying  There are 20 experimental and observational fields with good infrastructures, including 4 meteorological observation fields located in mountains, Gobi, desert and oasis, respectively; 1comprehensive observation field with 4auxiliary fields and 2 experiment plots in desert; 1comprehensive observation field with 5auxiliary fields and 2 experiment plots in oasis; and a long-term groundwater monitoring network in oasis."}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Master Site"}}}}
