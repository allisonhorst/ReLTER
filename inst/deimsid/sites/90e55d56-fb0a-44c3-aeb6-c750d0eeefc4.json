The annual mean temperature in this region is 15.5 \u00b0C, annual mean rainfall is 1,038 mm, and the frostfree period is 224 days. The main crops are rice in summer and wheat in winter; these crops are planted on annual rotation. The experimental site was planted with wheat in the previous winter and spring. The soil was flooded, plowed, and puddled after the removal of the crop. The soil in the site is classified as Gleyi-Stagnic Anthrosol (CRGCST 2001) developed from lacustrine sediments and has a texture of silt clay. The main properties of the soil at 0- to 15-cm depth are pH (1:1) of 7.35, 2.1 g kg\u22121 total N, 20.3 g kg\u22121 organic C, and bulk density of 1.11 g cm\u22123.","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1987,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Changshu Agro-Ecological Experimental Station","shortName":"Changshu Station","siteType":"Platform","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/DJI_0004.JPG","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2437.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2438.JPG","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2439.JPG","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2440.JPG","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":16.8,"min":-3.7,"max":36.6,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":1352,"min":8.1,"max":296.2,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"agricultural","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Agricultural","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats (I)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((120.6965 31.5497, 120.698 31.55, 120.6988 31.5498, 120.6987 31.5483, 120.6972 31.5478, 120.6963 31.5478, 120.6965 31.5497))","coordinates":"POINT (120.6984 31.5497)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":3,"min":2.5,"max":3.5,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":8,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"partly experimentation","scale":"beyond catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"beyond catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"agricultural parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20936"},{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":false,"accessType":null,"allPartsAccessible":false,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Data portal","uri":null},{"label":"Web Coverage Service (WCS)","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":[{"title":"","value":"http:\/\/csa.cern.ac.cn\/"}],"rights":["The data provider must be offered co-authorship for publications using this dataset at least within the metadata description","Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Master Site"}}}}
