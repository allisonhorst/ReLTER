Its climate is belong to tropical and subtropical mason climate, with an potential climatic production of 46-54 ton ha-1 year-1. The Abundant resources of light, temperature and water make this region an important base for the development of agriculture and economy in China. \r\nRed Soil Station is located at Liujiazhan, Yujiang County, Yingtan city, Jiangxi Province (116\u00b05\u203230\u2033and 28\u00b05\u203230\u2033, altitude 45 m a.s.l) ,135 km away from Nanchang city and 13 km away from Yingtan city. The Station has an typical subtropical moist climate, with an annual rainfall of 1785 mm, an annual mean air temperature of 17.8 \u2103, an annual accumulative temperature (\u003E10\u2103) of 5528\u2103, and 262 days free of frost. The main soil is slightly eroded barren land with sparse mason pine (Pinus massoniana L.) derived from Quaternary Red Clay. The vegetations is sparse mason pine (Pinus massoniana L.) and wild grasses, such as centipedegrass (Ere- mochloa ophiuroides ( Munro) Hack), tufted love-grass( Eragrostis psuch ilosa (L.) Beauv.), and needle-grass (mperata cylindrical (L.) Beauv. Var. major Hubb.) etc. before the station established. Double-rice is main cropping system in the paddy field and peanuts for upland in the local farms. Its environment is typical for the hilly region of red soil in Subtropical China, and suitable for research of this kind of ecosystem on experimental biology.\r\nMoreover, The Station covers 106 ha of land and 6 ha of water body, which are used for fuel forests, tea plantation, citrus orchards, pasture lands, pig farm, fish ponds, paddy fields, uplands, etc. and possesses  a comprehensive building of 3000 m2 including administration and guest offices, which equipped with computer, workstation and internet, and Laboratory building, which includes soil Physical-Chemical Analysis Lab., Microbial incubation Lab., Simulated Environment for Material-Cycling Lab equipped with precision instruments such as Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Graphite Stove- Flame Spectrometer, Infrared Gas Analyzer, UV-Visible Spectrometer, Leaf Area Meter, Global Positioner, TDR Soil Moisture Meter, and field facilities such as Meteorological observatory, Nutrient Lysimeter Moisture Evapotranspiration Meter and Runoff plots.\r\n","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1985,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Yingtan Ecological Experimental Station of Red Soil","shortName":"Red Soil Station","siteType":"Platform","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/2109.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid_2110.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid_2111.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid_2122.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid_2113.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":17.8,"min":17.8,"max":17.8,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":1785,"min":1785,"max":1785,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"agricultural","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Agricultural","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":null,"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((116.92 28.207, 116.925 28.206, 116.927 28.208, 116.93 28.209, 116.932 28.211, 116.935 28.211, 116.938 28.21, 116.935 28.206, 116.929 28.206, 116.929 28.203, 116.933 28.199, 116.926 28.203, 116.925 28.201, 116.919 28.201, 116.916 28.206, 116.92 28.207))","coordinates":"POINT (116.9283 28.2058)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":45,"min":45,"max":45,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":113,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"entire catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"agricultural parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20936"},{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"ecosystem ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21689"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"},{"label":"microbial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/77"},{"label":"terrestrial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/79"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"regular car","allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Data portal","uri":null},{"label":"Lysimeter","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["The data provider must be offered co-authorship for publications using this dataset at least within the metadata description","Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Master Site"}}}}
