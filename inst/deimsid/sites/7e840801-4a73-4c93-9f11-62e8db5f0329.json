The station is 8 km from the southern edge of the Gurbantonggut Desert and 72 km south of the highest peak of the eastern Tianshan Mountains (5445 m a.s.l.). The study area is fairly flat (slope \u003C 1o), and the groundwater table fluctuates between 2-5m depth. The soil is a silty clay-loam, consisting of 7% clay, 32% sand and 61% silt, with total nitrogen and C contents of 0.068 and 1.064%, respectively. The local climate is temperate continental arid with hot summers and cold winters. The winter extends from November to late March; and includes a snow cover of 20-30 cm. The growing season usually starts in early May and ends in late October. Mean annual air temperature is 6.6\u00b0C. Mean annual precipitation is 163 mm, with the majority of it (60-70%) falling between May and September.","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1987,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Fukang Desert Ecological Research Station","shortName":"Fukang Station","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid_2162.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid_2163.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":6.6,"min":-28,"max":35,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":163,"min":5,"max":69,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"desert","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Desert","uri":null},{"label":"Xeric basins","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":null,"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":null,"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((87.9307 44.2955, 87.9307 44.2912, 87.9457 44.2911, 87.9459 44.2955, 87.9307 44.2955))","coordinates":"POINT (87.9167 44.2833)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":null,"min":460,"max":475,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":65,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"beyond catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"beyond catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"landscape parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20943"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"conservation","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21663"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"},{"label":"hydrography","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/30004"},{"label":"hydrology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21747"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":null,"allPartsAccessible":true,"maintenanceInterval":null,"permanentPowerSupply":true,"operation":{"permanent":true,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":null},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Data portal","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["The data provider must be offered co-authorship for publications using this dataset at least within the metadata description","Formal acknowledgement of the dataset providers"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Regular Site"}}}}
