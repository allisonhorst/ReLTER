It was established in 1980 and  became a member of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) in 1991. In 2005, it was selected to be a National Key Field Research Station. In 2007, the Station became one of the Soil and Water Conservation Sci-Tech Demonstration Zones under the Ministry of Water Resources. It is also one of the observatory sites of Global Terrestrial Observation System (GTOS) and a key field station under the Ministry of Agriculture.\r\n      Yanting has a humid subtropical monsoon climate, with an annual average temperature of 17.5 \u2103 and an average annual rainfall of 826 mm, and its annual frost-free period is averagely 290 days.\r\n      Its landscape is featured by hills. The outcropped rock strata are purplish sand-mudstones formed in  Jurassic and Cretaceous period. The soil is called locally purple soil. It is classified as Eutric Regosols in the FAO Soil Taxonomy and as Pup-Orthic-Entisols in the Chinese Soil Taxonomy. Yanting Station represents typical farmland ecosystems dominated by purple soils in the Sichuan Basin in the subtropical region.\r\n","keywords":[{"label":"aboveground production","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1980,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":null},"siteName":"Yanting Agricultural Ecological Station on Purple Soil","shortName":"YGA_CN","siteType":"Platform","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/1990.JPG","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/iid1991.jpg","alt":"not defined"},{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/YANTING%2520Plan.jpg","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":17.3,"min":-2,"max":42,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":836,"min":0,"max":297,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"agricultural","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Agricultural","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Domestic gardens of villages and urban peripheries (X25)","uri":null},{"label":"Habitat complexes (X)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Terrestrial"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":null,"coordinates":"POINT (105.27 31.16)","country":["China"],"elevation":{"avg":420,"min":390,"max":550,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":13.34,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"mainly experimentation","scale":"catchment scale"},"observations":{"design":"mainly observation","scale":"entire catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"agricultural parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20936"},{"label":"atmospheric parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20937"},{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"genetic parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20942"},{"label":"landscape parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20943"},{"label":"soil parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20944"},{"label":"water parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20945"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"agriculture","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21605"},{"label":"climatology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21753"},{"label":"conservation","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21663"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"ecosystem ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21689"},{"label":"environmental science","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21768"},{"label":"hydrology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21747"},{"label":"meteorology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21752"},{"label":"terrestrial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/79"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"regular car","allPartsAccessible":false,"maintenanceInterval":30,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":1},"notes":"Series of free-drain lysimeters.
