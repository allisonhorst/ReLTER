The coastal area, which is inhabited since pre-Roman age, is densely populated and small factories are actively growing. In the Gulf, polluted areas (Sarno river mouth, harbours) coexist with pristine areas, including some Protected Marine Areas. Research on marine organisms has started before since the beginning of 1800, but first ecological studies date back to the 70ies of the last century. A long-term monitoring station (LTER-MC, 49\u00b049\u2019N, 14\u00b015\u2019E) is located 2 nm off Naples city (depth ca 80 m) at the boundary between eutrophied coastal waters and oligotrophic Tyrrhenian waters. Larger areas of the Gulf have been sampled occasionally in several cruises. The main research at these sites addresses plankton variability in response to environmental forcing. Plankton samples are collected along with environmental data at a weekly scale, and species identification is performed  with traditional methods coupled with Electron microscopy and molecular tools. Phytoplankton species are often grown in the lab for experimental work or taxonomic analyses, which have led to the discovery of about 15 new microalgal species. Special investigations have addressed, among other topics, the role of viruses in the demise of algal blooms, the rate of dinoflagellate cyst production over the seasons, the rhythm of sexual reproduction in diatoms and grazing of meso- and microzooplankton. The MC data set represents one of the few plankton time series available in the Mediterranean Sea, and it is certainly one of the longest.  Extensive seagrass meadows are located around the flegrean islands: the endemic Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile infact can grow both on rock and sand substrates. In this area, in the last decades a reduction in shoot density has been detected, as a result of anchoring, the impact of the local fishery and water quality. Around the island of Ischia (within a Marine Protected Area), Posidonia oceanica forms a continuous belt (0.5-38 m depth), covering about 17 km2 of the seafloor. The best known meadow (Station LTER-LA), studied since 1979, is located in the northern part of the island (40\u00b041,582 N, 13\u00b053,361 E). Only in this station, the meadow is continuous from 0.5 m down to 32 m depth, covering an area of about 3 kmq. Other meadows have also been monitored. In recent years at the station Castello Aragonese (40\u00b043,51 N, 13\u00b057,55 E), where natural CO2 emissions allow for the study of ecosystem responses to ocean acidification, is under monitoring.The main research lines are focused on the responses of marine plants and associated communities to environmental variability and changes. Plant-animal interactions, spanning from biodiversity and distribution patterns in space and time to phylogenetic and phylogeographic traits, from trophic-chemical relationships to life-history features and molecular phylogeography and speciation are also investigated.","keywords":[{"label":"animal ecology","uri":null},{"label":"biodiversity","uri":null}],"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1978,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":null,"children":[{"type":"site","title":"LTER Lacco Ameno - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"4a05a2fb-0015-4310-96d5-a94c019bda58"},"changed":"2021-09-14T13:15:06+0200"},{"type":"site","title":"LTER Marechiara - Italy","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"0b87459a-da3c-45af-a3e1-cb1508519411"},"changed":"2021-02-24T12:50:30+0100"}]},"siteName":"IT13-Gulf of Naples","shortName":"IT13-000-M","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/GolfoNapoli.JPG","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":15.5,"min":15,"max":27,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":1007,"min":24,"max":162,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"marine","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Marine","uri":null},{"label":"Temperate shelfs and seas","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Marine habitats (A)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Marine"],"geology":null,"hydrology":null,"soils":null,"vegetation":null},"geographic":{"boundaries":"POLYGON ((14.202766294657 40.513200234666, 13.844327446663 40.706364730715, 13.826008051311 40.752620147315, 14.006182067772 40.791151291955, 14.088058887094 40.78700772831, 14.075616269499 40.822798590123, 14.114249393852 40.829711064945, 14.156278913124 40.815881738189, 14.189426363461 40.790334912129, 14.233281789246 40.83167086215, 14.251074116434 40.826684260639, 14.268237417477 40.846613028339, 14.419561308371 40.751070716027, 14.453445254818 40.757594793434, 14.488821503014 40.705527221366, 14.202766294657 40.513200234666))","coordinates":"POINT (14.1994 40.6942)","country":["Italy"],"elevation":{"avg":-140,"min":0,"max":-280,"unit":"msl"},"size":{"value":87000,"unit":"ha"},"relatedLocations":null},"focusDesignScale":{"experiments":{"design":"partly experimentation","scale":"micro sites"},"observations":{"design":"partly observation","scale":"beyond catchment"},"parameters":[{"label":"biological parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20940"},{"label":"ecosystem parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20939"},{"label":"genetic parameter","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/20942"}],"researchTopics":[{"label":"aquatic ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/80"},{"label":"biodiversity","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21673"},{"label":"biology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21611"},{"label":"ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21672"},{"label":"ecophysiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21652"},{"label":"genetics","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21613"},{"label":"marine ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/68"},{"label":"microbial ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/77"},{"label":"physiology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21651"},{"label":"plant ecology","uri":"http:\/\/vocabs.lter-europe.net\/EnvThes\/21710"}]},"infrastructure":{"accessibleAllYear":true,"accessType":"boat","allPartsAccessible":false,"maintenanceInterval":7,"permanentPowerSupply":false,"operation":{"permanent":false,"notes":null,"siteVisitInterval":7},"notes":null,"collection":[{"label":"Boat","uri":null},{"label":"Marine Platform","uri":null},{"label":"Other data services","uri":null}],"data":{"policy":{"url":null,"rights":["Co-authorship on publications resulting from use of the dataset"],"notes":null}}},"relatedResources":null,"projectRelated":{"lter":{"lterSiteClassification":"Regular Site"}}}}
