SNP is situated in the Solu-Khumbu district, in the north-eastern\r\nregion of Nepal and represents the northernmost part of the Dudh Koshi River Basin, which is part of the Koshi River Basin (or SaptaKoshi Basin), one of the seven major hydrographic basins into which Nepal is subdivided. The SNP covers an area of 1141 km2 and is surrounded on all sides by the highest mountain ranges on Earth. The terrain is extremely irregular, with altitudes that reach 8848 m. The lower topographic limit of permanent snow cover is located at an altitude of 5500\u20135600 m. The climate of the SNP is driven by the Asian monsoon.\r\nThe lake bedrock is mainly Late Tertiary Granites, with a primarily quartz\u2013silicate composition and a low weathering rate. Soils are absent or very thin in most of the catchments. Vegetation cover is restricted to small areas of alpine meadow. The lake surface area is 0.009 km2. The lake lies above 5000 m a.s.l., the tree line limit. The lake is fed by a small glacier located in the catchment. The lake is  ice-covered for ca. 9\u201310 months every year (from October\u2013November to June\u2013July). Chlorophyll a concentrations are below 1 lg l-1 and are probably controlled by strong grazing pressure from a large pigmented (keto-carotenoid of astaxanthin type) zooplankton community. Total phosphorus concentrations (mean values) are about 2 \u00b5g P l-1, whereas total nitrate concentrations are about 120 \u00b5g N l-1. Concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are very low.\r\n","keywords":null,"status":{"label":"Operational","uri":"https:\/\/codes.wmo.int\/wmdr\/ReportingStatus\/operational"},"yearEstablished":1992,"yearClosed":null,"hierarchy":{"parent":[{"type":"site","title":"IT11-Himalayan Lakes - Nepal","id":{"prefix":"https:\/\/deims.org\/","suffix":"53c835b3-9ecb-4613-9b96-6b36356e83a8"},"changed":"2021-11-23T11:15:09+0100"}],"children":null},"siteName":"Lago Piramide Superiore","shortName":"IT11-001-A","siteType":"Stationary land-based site","protectionLevel":null,"landUse":null,"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/deims.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/Lake%2520superior1%2528d%2529.JPG","alt":"not defined"}]},"environmentalCharacteristics":{"airTemperature":{"avg":-2.5,"min":null,"max":null,"unit":"\u00b0C"},"precipitation":{"annual":520,"min":null,"max":null,"unit":"mm"},"biogeographicalRegion":null,"biome":"alpine","ecosystemType":[{"label":"Alpine","uri":null},{"label":"Fresh Water Lakes","uri":null},{"label":"Lakes","uri":null},{"label":"Small lakes","uri":null}],"eunisHabitat":[{"label":"Inland surface waters (C)","uri":null},{"label":"Surface standing waters (C1)","uri":null}],"landforms":null,"geoBonBiome":["Fresh water lakes"],"geology":"The lake bedrock is mainly Late Tertiary Granites, with a primarily quartz?silicate composition and a low weathering rate.","hydrology":"The lake is fed by a small glacier located in the catchment.
